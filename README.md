# Khaled Pendleton - personal portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. As both a graphic designer and web developer its imperative that I have some form of digital protfolio. My main goals for this project were:

* Own and cultivate my own little portion of the web
* Have a public facing, easily accessible, space that I can point potential employers, clients, and friends that may be interested in my life and work
* Learn about Svelte.js, the newest Javascript framework on the block

## Technologies

* *[Svelte](https://svelte.dev)* - Yet another new Javascript framework. Svelte is no ordinary client-side UI library however. Unlike other common frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue, Svelte is a compiler. That means that "instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes."
* *[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev)* - A **very opinionated** Node.js framework built by the Svelte team specifically for Svelte applications. Sapper makes it easy to develop web applications of any size. I used it export my website, blog and all, as a static site. 
* *[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)* - A static website host from Github.
